Scriptish/GreaseMonkey port of the Chrome HoverZoom plugin 
Chrome Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nonjdcjchghhkdoolnlbekcfllmednbl
Google Code Repository: https://code.google.com/p/hoverzoom/

Original conversion by Jon Moses ( https://github.com/jmoses/gm-hover-zoom )

*Only the Imgur plugin is in there, so only imgur links will work right now.*

My goal is to retain as much common code as possible with the google code repository to allow me to merge code changes more easily.
